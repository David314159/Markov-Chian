# Markov-Chian
A simple, modular Markov chain that can be used to generate new sentences based on data.

To use the Markov chain, simply add a large amount of text to the "data.txt" file. The text should resemble the kind of text you want the Markov chain to output (e.g. if you add text from a cookbook, it will produce sentences that vaugely resemble that of a recepie.)

Once you've added your data, simply run the "main.py" file, and the program will print the results in your terminal.
